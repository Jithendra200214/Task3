## Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

### Tools
- MySQL Workbench

### What I Did
- Wrote queries using `SELECT *` and specific column selection.
- Applied filters with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`.
- Sorted results using `ORDER BY`.
- Limited rows displayed with `LIMIT`.

### Outcome
Gained a clear understanding of how to:
- Retrieve all or selected data from tables.
- Filter records based on conditions.
- Sort and limit results for better readability.
